# Chat Interface - Figma Design Implementation

This project is a pixel-perfect implementation of a Figma design for a chat/assistant interface, built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The design has been made fully responsive for desktop and laptop screen sizes.

## üé® Design Features

- **Pixel-perfect Figma clone** - Exact recreation of the original 1440x1024 design
- **Fully responsive** - Scales beautifully across all desktop and laptop screen sizes
- **Modern UI** - Dark theme with gradient elements and smooth animations
- **Interactive elements** - Hover states and transitions for better UX

## üì± Responsive Design

The interface is designed to work perfectly across all major desktop and laptop screen sizes:

- **1024px and up** - Laptop screens
- **1440px and up** - Standard desktop screens  
- **1920px and up** - Large desktop screens
- **Ultra-wide screens** - Content scales proportionally without cutoff

### Responsive Features

- **Fluid typography** - Text scales proportionally with screen size
- **Adaptive spacing** - Margins and padding adjust for different screen sizes
- **Flexible layouts** - Components reflow and resize appropriately
- **No content cutoff** - All elements remain fully visible at any resolution

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack
- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React 19** for UI components

### Key Components

- `ChatInterface` - Main component with responsive layout
- `CategoryButton` - Reusable button component with active states
- Custom CSS classes for enhanced typography and animations

### Asset Management
All Figma assets (icons, images, SVGs) have been extracted and optimized for web use, stored in `/public/assets/`.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. **Run development server**
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

3. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## üìê Design System

### Colors
- Primary background: `#1c1c1c`
- Secondary background: `#222222`
- Input background: `#413e3e`
- Button background: `#504e4e`
- Text: `#ffffff`
- Muted text: `#858484`

### Typography
- Font family: DM Sans (with system fallbacks)
- Responsive font scaling using `clamp()` functions
- Proper font weights and line heights

### Spacing
- Responsive padding and margins using Tailwind's responsive prefixes
- Consistent spacing scale that adapts to screen size

## üéØ Responsive Breakpoints

The design uses these breakpoints for optimal scaling:

- `sm:` (640px+) - Small laptop screens
- `md:` (768px+) - Medium screens
- `lg:` (1024px+) - Large laptop screens
- `xl:` (1280px+) - Desktop screens
- `2xl:` (1536px+) - Large desktop screens

## üîß Customization

The component is highly customizable:

- Modify colors in the CSS variables
- Adjust responsive breakpoints in the component classes
- Update typography scaling in `globals.css`
- Add new category buttons by extending the `CategoryButton` component

## üì± Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- All modern browsers with CSS Grid and Flexbox support

## üé® Design Credits
