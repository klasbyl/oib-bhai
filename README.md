# AI Chat Interface - Figma Design Implementation

This project is a pixel-perfect implementation of a Figma design for an AI chat/assistant interface, built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The design has been made fully responsive for desktop and laptop screen sizes and now includes real AI chat functionality powered by xAI's Grok 3 Mini model.

## üé® Design Features

- **Pixel-perfect Figma clone** - Exact recreation of the original 1440x1024 design
- **Fully responsive** - Scales beautifully across all desktop and laptop screen sizes
- **Modern UI** - Dark theme with gradient elements and smooth animations
- **Interactive elements** - Hover states and transitions for better UX

## üì± Responsive Design

The interface is designed to work perfectly across all major desktop and laptop screen sizes:

- **1024px and up** - Laptop screens
- **1440px and up** - Standard desktop screens  
- **1920px and up** - Large desktop screens
- **Ultra-wide screens** - Content scales proportionally without cutoff

### Responsive Features

- **Fluid typography** - Text scales proportionally with screen size
- **Adaptive spacing** - Margins and padding adjust for different screen sizes
- **Flexible layouts** - Components reflow and resize appropriately
- **No content cutoff** - All elements remain fully visible at any resolution

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Tech Stack
- **Next.js 15** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **React 19** for UI components
- **AI SDK** for xAI integration
- **xAI Grok 3 Mini** for AI chat functionality

### Key Components

- `ChatInterface` - Main component with responsive layout
- `CategoryButton` - Reusable button component with active states
- Custom CSS classes for enhanced typography and animations

### Asset Management
All Figma assets (icons, images, SVGs) have been extracted and optimized for web use, stored in `/public/assets/`.

## ü§ñ AI Chat Features

The interface now includes real AI chat functionality:

- **Real-time AI responses** powered by xAI's Grok 3 Mini model
- **Streaming responses** for better user experience
- **Error handling** with retry mechanisms
- **Rate limiting** protection
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **Conversation management** with persistent threads

### AI Components

- `useAIChat` - React hook for chat functionality
- `AIChatService` - Service layer for API interactions
- `/api/chat` - Next.js API route with streaming support
- Type-safe interfaces for all AI operations

## üîß Environment Setup

1. **Get xAI API Key**
   - Visit [x.ai/api](https://x.ai/api) to get your API key
   - Sign up for an account if you don't have one

2. **Configure Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Create .env.local file in project root
   XAI_API_KEY=your_xai_api_key_here

   # Optional production settings
   NODE_ENV=production
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   ```

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

2. **Run development server**
   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

3. **Open in browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## üìê Design System

### Colors
- Primary background: `#1c1c1c`
- Secondary background: `#222222`
- Input background: `#413e3e`
- Button background: `#504e4e`
- Text: `#ffffff`
- Muted text: `#858484`

### Typography
- Font family: DM Sans (with system fallbacks)
- Responsive font scaling using `clamp()` functions
- Proper font weights and line heights

### Spacing
- Responsive padding and margins using Tailwind's responsive prefixes
- Consistent spacing scale that adapts to screen size

## üéØ Responsive Breakpoints

The design uses these breakpoints for optimal scaling:

- `sm:` (640px+) - Small laptop screens
- `md:` (768px+) - Medium screens
- `lg:` (1024px+) - Large laptop screens
- `xl:` (1280px+) - Desktop screens
- `2xl:` (1536px+) - Large desktop screens

## üîß Customization

The component is highly customizable:

- Modify colors in the CSS variables
- Adjust responsive breakpoints in the component classes
- Update typography scaling in `globals.css`
- Add new category buttons by extending the `CategoryButton` component

## üì± Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- All modern browsers with CSS Grid and Flexbox support

## üé® Design Credits
